# TinyCapture

**Minimalistic screen capture program.**

Great for writing documentation, articles and blog posts.  Nothing to install, no dependancies. Just single .exe you put in your tools folder and run when needed or configure to autostart.

By default, pressing Windows + F9 will capture current window. Pressing Win + F10 win capture entire screen. Screenshot would immediately get saved to image with the name of the window and make that name unique.

Right click on tray and and create default.ini if you want to change some things around:

- location where images are saved
- hotkeys
- wheter you want to see notifications when capture happens
